            For now the only way to do so is via <router-link to="/urbit" class="custom-link">Urbit</router-link>. Someday, we'll have centralized servers like Lichess and Chess.com.

            Nichess is a superset of chess—it has everything chess has and more. It's only a matter of time before a Nichess variant is made that's better than chess.

            Unfortunately, even a small change requires retraining the AI from scratch. We appreciate the suggestions, but don't expect frequent changes once a variant is released. As more people get involved, we'll be able to make changes more frequently.

            The AI is running locally, on your device. Its skill level depends on your hardware and software. If the performance is poor, try a different browser or a device. Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Brave, Edge etc.) tend to perform a bit better than Firefox.

            Sometimes it can take a while to download the AI model. Make sure you have a good internet connection.
